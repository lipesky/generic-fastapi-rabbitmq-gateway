# Generic Fastapi/RabbitMQ Gateway Server

This repository holds the code for a blank microservice that uses patio, rabbitmq in an async approach to handle requests and distributes to processing microsservices in request-reply approach, with distributed rpc calls thanks to patio.

You can use this as basis for other gateway microservices.

The example sends request to queue to be consumed by (Generic consumer)[https://github.com/lipesky/generic-fastapi-rabbitmq-consumer]

Pull requests are welcome.
